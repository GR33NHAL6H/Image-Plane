# Image Plane

## A lightweight tool for creating 3D projections in Nuke

Once a camera is plugged in and the reference frame is set, the projection will be set up for you. You have the option to change between using a card, sphere or your own geometry and will move according to the distance set in the settings.
This has all the fixes you may need for dealing with a 3D projections in Nuke using the Scanline Renderer including reformating the canvas size before and after projecting to help with painting in the overscan
